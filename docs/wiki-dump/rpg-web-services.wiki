!! XMLSERVICE Introduction
XMLSERVICE is Open Source RPG, created for web programming simplicity and deployment flexibility, any language, any transport, avoiding complexities dealing with big package 'web services'. Internally, XMLSERVICE is designed Plain Old XML (POX), which enables simple REST XML protocol, avoiding complexity of SOAP/WSDL based Web Services. XMLSERVICE is 100% RPG, never requires Java, PHP, or any other front end language to serve your IBM i RPG programs to the web. In fact, XMLSERVICE is so simple, that you can almost run your entire IBM i machine using only simple HTML/XML (demonstrated later section).

XMLSERVICE is a single library of Open Source RPG code that enables XML scripting calls of System i resources\\\
XMLSERVICE RPG source download found at [[http://youngiprofessionals.com/wiki/index.php/XMLSERVICE/XMLSERVICE | Yips XMLSERVICE]].\\\
XMLSERVICE introduction foils and working examples [[http://youngiprofessionals.com/wiki/index.php/XMLSERVICE/XMLSERVICEIntro | Yips XMLSERVICE Introduction]]\\\
XMLSERVICE RPG server library does not require other language products to run on your IBM i, however language teams often provide a client toolkit to greatly simplify XML calls to XMLSERVICE.
[[<<]]

XMLSERVICE, as name implies, enables XML services on your IBM i machine. XMLSERVICE library is simply a collection of Open Source RPG modules that essentially allow your to access anything on your IBM i machine, assuming proper profile authority. Simply stated, XMLSERVICE accepts XML document containing actions/parameters [@(<pgm>,<cmd>,<sh>,<sql>,etc.)@], performs requested operations on IBM i, then sends an XML document of results back to the client. This simple concept has become a powerful tool for scripting language clients on IBM i including Zend Server PHP Toolkit and PowerRuby Toolkit. However, PHP and Ruby are not unique to XMLSERVICE, XML is a universal protocol support by nearly every language, therefore nearly any language can use XMLSERVICE, and most any transport between client/server.

!!! Installation
Installation of XMLSERVICE Open Source is trivial for any IBM i person.

Note: Other CLP exist for other team production libraries.
      XMLSERVICE PGM objects are coded to compile library only,
      therefore you cannot SAV/RST PGM, etc. to other libraries.

!!! IBM PTFs
IBM i traditionalists comfortable with 'supported software' as no compile required, may choose IBM i PTFs to avoid download/compile of XMLSERVICE. However, xmlservice source code, tests (ZZCALL), non-production goodies, are not included with IBM i PTFs (size restrictions), therefore, i suggest download matching zip file version for tests and other non-production goodies referenced in this narrative.
[@
V7R1 PTF SI50835 (1.8.1) replaces V7R1 PTF SI48830 (1.7.5)
V6R1 PTF SI50834 (1.8.1) replaces V6R1 PTF SI48831 (1.7.5)
V5R4 PTF SI48440 (1.7.5) no additional PTFs planned

Note: IBM PTF library is QXMLSERV (not XMLSERVICE library).

!!!! IBM i CCSID 65535
XMLSERVICE REST and DB2 connections have implicit CCSID conversion between client and server, therefore your XMLIN/XMLOUT XML document will be implicitly CCSID converted by the transport layer, to wit, XMLSERVICE should just work. However, IBM i CCSID 65535 (hex), will destroy the entire XMLSERVICE scheme, and you will witness horrible hangs, junk data, dead processes, etc., so please take action on your IBM i to live with the modern ASCII world (all clients, all new scripting languages, remote/local including PASE).

'''Check your IBM i for CCSID convert safety.'''\\
If you see DSPSYSVAL 65535, you have a big problem with the ASCII world, but you can take corrective IBM i action.
[@
DSPSYSVAL SYSVAL(QCCSID)
 Coded character set
   identifier . . . . . :   65535      1-65535
@]

Here are some corrective IBM i suggestions (CCSID 37 an example), but remember you have to end current running jobs and restart for the CCSID changes to enable (including XTOOLKIT jobs):
* change system ccsid\\
[@
CHGSYSVAL SYSVAL(QCCSID) VALUE(37)
@]
* change Apache instances (/www/instance/httpd.conf)\\
[@
# protect FastCGI against bad CCSID (dspsysval qccsid 65535)
DefaultFsCCSID 37
CGIJobCCSID 37
@]
* change user profile(s)\\
[@
CHGUSRPRF USRPRF(FRED) CCSID(37)
@]

!!!! Connection public or private
XMLSERVICE parameters CTL and IPC enable two types of connections.
* public connection -- XMLSERVICE stateless, many jobs, every use a fresh start
** [@ CTL='*here' , IPC="*NA" @]
*** "public" because any IBM i profile use is a fresh start
*** life scope -- life of a single XML IN/OUT request
* private connection -- XMLSERVICE state full, single job, where a given profile is routed to XTOOLKIT job(s)
** [@ CTL='*sbmjob' , IPC="/tmp/myjob1" @]
*** [@ CTL='*sbmjob' @] -- if not running, submit a new XTOOLKIT job
*** [@ IPC="/tmp/myjob1" @] -- all requests of IPC route to XTOOLKIT job (*sbmjob)
*** "private" because ONE IBM i profile owns XTOOLKIT job, any other IBM i profile will fail to attach
*** life scope -- forever, until ended by operator or user program ends XTOOLKIT job (like a 5250)

'''When to use XMLSERVICE public or private?'''\\
Of course any discussion that presumes to predict usage is likely to have legitimate user exception, but a guideline may be appropriate for use of XMLSERVICE public vs. private connection.

'''Web programming style (public, stateless)'''\\
XMLSERVICE public connections are generally used when IBM i resource can be called once by many different user profiles, current data returned, no lasting persistent data needed by the IBM i resource. The programmer meta description of transient resource services is "stateless programming". 

%lfloat width=400 height=300%[[http://youngiprofessionals.com/wiki/index.php/XMLSERVICE/XMLSERVICE | {$Imagehard}redbook_stateless.png"XMLSERVICE"]]%%\\
XMLSERVICE public "stateless"\\
(CTL='*here', IPC='*NA')\\
- profile FRED (any public QSQ)\\
- profile SALLY (any public QSQ)\\
- profile RITA (any public QSQ)\\
- profile XAVIER (any public QSQ)\\\
XMLSTOREDP->XMLSERVICE (QSQ)
- QSQ temporary profile use (stateless)\\
- QSQ return to pool on script end\\
- XMLSERVICE restart every request (web style)
[[<<]]
Although very handy, clean wrkactjob, no hanging locks, etc., public connection is not a high performance use of XMLSERVICE.
* public connection -- XMLSERVICE stateless, many jobs, every use a fresh start
** [@ CTL='*here' , IPC="*NA" @] -- profile FRED (RPG company stock service)
** [@ CTL='*here' , IPC="*NA" @] -- profile SALLY (RPG IRS flat tax rate service)
** [@ CTL='*here' , IPC="*NA" @] -- profile RITA (RPG calculate pound to kilo)
** [@ CTL='*here' , IPC="*NA" @] -- profile XAVIER (RPG company stock service)

'''Traditional programming style (private, state full)'''\\
XMLSERVICE private connections are generally used when IBM i resource will be called many times by the same user profile, lasting persistent data needed by the IBM i resource (RPG variables, open files, etc.). The programmer meta description of required data services is "state full programming". 

%lfloat width=600 height=400%[[http://youngiprofessionals.com/wiki/index.php/XMLSERVICE/XMLSERVICE | {$Imagehard}redbook_statefull.png"XMLSERVICE"]]%%\\
XMLSERVICE private "state full"\\
 (CTL='*sbmjob', IPC='/tmp/xxxx')\\
- profile FRED XTOOLKIT myjob1,myjob2 (private)\\
- profile SALLY XTOOLKIT sallyjob1 (private)\\
- profile RITA XTOOLKIT nursejob (private)\\
- profile XAVIER XTOOLKIT xjob1 - xjob5 (private)\\\
XMLSTOREDP (QSQ)\\
- QSQ temporary profile use (stateless)\\
- QSQ return to pool on script end\\\
XMLSERVICE (XTOOLKIT)\\
- XTOOLKIT owned by profile (private)\\
- XTOOLKIT job never ends (until killed)\\
- XTOOLKIT full state programming (5250 style)
[[<<]]
Traditional RPG programs usually need to track local variables, open files, etc., between requests, both for correct functionality and performance. The XTOOLKIT jobs that result from [@ CTL='*sbmjob' , IPC="/tmp/xxxx" @] are similar to 5250 jobs, where a user profile signs on, then uses 5250 job to run other programs (aka XMLSERVICE design), also, like multiple 5250 sessions (PC emulators), many different XTOOLKIT jobs can be used by the same user profile.
* private connection -- XMLSERVICE state full, single job, where a given profile is routed to same XTOOLKIT job
** [@ CTL='*sbmjob' , IPC="/tmp/myjob1" @] -- profile FRED XTOOLKIT myjob1 (Fred's use only RPG payroll application)
** [@ CTL='*sbmjob' , IPC="/tmp/myjob2" @] -- profile FRED XTOOLKIT myjob2 (Fred's use only RPG inventory application)
** [@ CTL='*sbmjob' , IPC="/tmp/sallyjob1" @] -- profile SALLY XTOOLKIT sallyjob1 (Sally's use only RPG admissions application)
** [@ CTL='*sbmjob' , IPC="/tmp/nursejob" @] -- profile RITA XTOOLKIT nursejob (Rita's use only RPG nurse scheduling application)
** [@ CTL='*sbmjob' , IPC="/tmp/xjob1" @] -- profile XAVIER XTOOLKIT xjob1 (Xavier's use only RPG payroll application)
** [@ CTL='*sbmjob' , IPC="/tmp/xjob2" @] -- profile XAVIER XTOOLKIT xjob2 (Xavier's use only RPG inventory application)
** [@ CTL='*sbmjob' , IPC="/tmp/xjob3" @] -- profile XAVIER XTOOLKIT xjob3 (Xavier's use only RPG admissions application)
** [@ CTL='*sbmjob' , IPC="/tmp/xjob4" @] -- profile XAVIER XTOOLKIT xjob4 (Xavier's use only RPG nurse scheduling application)
** [@ CTL='*sbmjob' , IPC="/tmp/xjob5" @] -- profile XAVIER XTOOLKIT xjob5 (Xavier's use only RPG super hero application)
** IBM i programmer: Profile Xavier is using many XTOOLKIT jobs (xjob1 - xjob5), many different applications, but Xavier cannot use Fred's, Sally's or Rita's XTOOLKIT jobs (myjob1,myjob2,sallyjob1,nursejob), because Xavier does not own other profile XTOOLKIT jobs. XTOOLKIT jobs should be an easy pattern for RPG programmers familiar with single session 5250 job(s), owned by a profile, one thing at a time (not threaded), long running RPG programs, many IBM i files open, etc. 
*** However, XTOOLKIT jobs have an interesting characteristic that 5250 emulator jobs cannot match, profile owned XTOOLKIT jobs can be accessed by many different client devices all at the same time, to wit, Xavier can use a laptop and a smart phone to all jobs at the same time (xjob1 - xjob5), or Xavier can leave his work laptop running (connected), go home, have dinner, and continue working all XTOOLKIT jobs from the family iPAD.
** IBM i operator: You may wrkactjob and kill [@*immed@] XTOOLKIT jobs (same as 5250).
*** However, an ipcs administrative cleaner solution may suggest you write a custom XMLSERVICE program [@CTL='*immed' , IPC="/tmp/myjob1"@], to remove "in the way" XTOOLKIT jobs (suggestion only).

We should note, that by any standard the following trivial XMLSERVICE example is clearly REST web services, but no SOAP, no WSDL, no Java, no PHP, no Ruby, nothing but 2 cents worth of HTML/XML.

!!! Instructions for your IBM i machine

'''Step 1)''' - Add XMLSERVICE to any Apache instance (APACHEDFT)\\
Set up your Apache to enable XMLSERVICE REST using RPG program XMLCGI.PGM included in XMLSERVICE installation, then restart your Apache instance.
[@
/www/apachedft/conf/httpd.conf:
ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /QSYS.LIB/XMLSERVICE.LIB/
<Directory /QSYS.LIB/XMLSERVICE.LIB/>
  AllowOverride None
  order allow,deny
  allow from all
  SetHandler cgi-script
  Options +ExecCGI
</Directory>

start Apache instance:
STRTCPSVR SERVER(*HTTP) HTTPSVR(APACHEDFT)
@]

'''Step 2)''' - Ready to use XMLSERVICE for HTML/XML\\
Cut/Paste following HTML/XML form to your laptop Desktop/strsql.html:
* change action target to your actual machine [@action="http://myibmi/cgi-bin/xmlcgi.pgm"@]
* point your favorite browser at the HTML file [@file:///home/adc/Desktop/strsql.html@]
** enter database (*LOCAL), user (your profile), password (your password)
** enter a SQL query in HTML strsql command and press button [@STRSQL@] \\
[@
desktop/strsql.html:
<html>
<head>
<script>
function getVal() {
xml = "<?xml version='1.0'?>";
xml += "<myscript>";
xml += "<sql>";
xml += "<query>";
xml += document.getElementById('strsql').value;
xml += "</query>";
xml += "<fetch block='all' desc='on'>";
xml += "</fetch>";
xml += "</sql>";
xml += "</myscript>";
document.getElementById('xmlin').value = xml;
}
</script>
</head>
<body>
<h3>STRSQL</h3>
<form onsubmit="getVal();" name="input" action="http://myibmi/cgi-bin/xmlcgi.pgm" method="post">
<br><input type="text" name="db2" value="*LOCAL" size="40" > database

<br><br><input type="submit" value="STRSQL" />
</form>

'''desktop/strsql.html example'''\\
As strsql.html name implies, this simple html enables STRSQL running from your laptop to your IBM i. Enter any SQL statement you wish in the html form and XMLSERVICE will run just like STRSQL green screen when you press the [@STRSQL@] button. XMLSERVICE output returned will be XML (of course), so if your browser has issues displaying XML, you may have to view page source. 

HTML form strsql.html uses simple JavaScript function [@getVal()@] with [@document.getElementById('strsql').value@], which reads HTML text input [@<input id='strsql'@] and adds user SQL request to XML document to HTML text input [@<input id="xmlin"@]. All XMLSERVICE required REST tag elements can bee seen in the following HTML form [@http://myibmi/cgi-bin/xmlcgi.pgm?db2=*LOCAL@uid=MYUID@pwd=MYPWD@ipc=*NA@ctl="*here *cdata"@xmlin=(see JavaScript)@xmlout=500000@], but we will cover this in later sections.

'''What is happening?'''\\
If we change [@method="post"@] to [@method="get"@], the fully encoded document will appear on the browser URL line. As you can see, when input arrives from our browser (or REST client), XMLSERVICE/XMLCGI.PGM has much HTTP decoding before actually parsing the XML document and servicing the request.
[@
<form onsubmit="getVal();" name="input" action="http://myibmi/cgi-bin/xmlcgi.pgm" method="post">
-- change --
<form onsubmit="getVal();" name="input" action="http://myibmi/cgi-bin/xmlcgi.pgm" method="get">

The follow cut/paste is one continuous browser line (split for viewing):
http://myibmi/cgi-bin/xmlcgi.pgm?db2=*LOCAL
&uid=MYUID
&pwd=MYPWD
&ipc=*NA
&ctl=*here+*cdata
&xmlin=%3C%3Fxml+version%3D%271.0%27%3F%3E
       %3Cmyscript%3E
       %3Csql%3E
       %3Cquery%3Eselect+*+from+db2%2Fanimals
       %3C%2Fquery%3E
       %3Cfetch+block%3D%27all%27+desc%3D%27on%27%3E
       %3C%2Ffetch%3E
       %3C%2Fsql%3E
       %3C%2Fmyscript%3E
&xmlout=500000
&strsql=select+*+from+db2%2Fanimals
@]
 
The flow:
* We point our browser [@file:///home/adc/Desktop/strsql.html@], enter SQL query and press [@STRSQL@] button
* IBM i Apache XMLCGI.PGM receives our encoded HTML/XML form [@action="http://myibmi/cgi-bin/xmlcgi.pgm"@]
* XMLCGI.PGM calls XMLSERVICE.PGM (using DB2 stored procedures iPLUGxxx, but you do not need to know this yet). 
* XMLSERVICE.PGM parses XML input and runs internal DB2 driver [@<sql><query>...</query></sql>@].
* XMLSERVICE.PGM parses result set from DB2 driver into output XML document [@<sql><fetch/></sql>@]
* browser sees XML return of DB2 data 

XMLSERVICE is Open Source, so you can examine internals of XMLCGI.PGM, for now , we simply need to understand XMLCGI.PGM decodes HTML/XML document, passes XML document request to XMLSERVICE.PGM (DB2 request example), and returns XML output to client (browser). If REST client is not a browser, but a scripting language like PHP or Ruby, exact same sequence occurs, except additionally most languages offer an XML parser to parse output XML into variables or structures (PHP Toolkit or Ruby Toolkit).

!!! Quick test functions HTML/XML
XMLSERVICE HTML/XML technique can be used for nearly anything on IBM i machine CMD, PGM, SRVPGM, system APIs, PASE utilities, DB2, etc. Feel free to copy strsql.html form, modify, and try other XMLSERVICE functions [@<myscript>other functions</myscript>@]. HTML/XML technique is a very handy testing a potential XMLSERVICE program service without writing a line of code, and, clearly demonstrates elegant simplicity embodied by XMLSERVICE.  

!! XMLSERVICE DB2 interface
DB2 connection is not a web service, but many languages support high speed DB2 local/remote requests, so XMLSERVICE included a stored procedures interface (iPLUG4K - iPLUG15M). The nature of DB2 stored procedures requires a size specified on in/out parameters, therefore XMLSERVICE library includes various iPLUGxx sizes to fit your XML document data needs (4K, 32K, 65K, 512K, 1M, 5M, 10M, up to 15M). 

We should note, XMLSERVICE DB2 is much faster over REST interface, so many language toolkits offer DB2 connection as the premier service.

!! XMLSERVICE REST interface
XMLSERVICE includes a simple REST interface (XMLCGI.PGM), we demonstrated using the REST service using only HTML/XML in a previous section. Most languages support REST calls, so XMLSERVICE REST interface can be very useful for cloud applications where DB2 drivers are not available. XMLSERVICE has REST production clients in most every scripting language you can imagine (PHP, Ruby, perl, python, etc.).

! RPG and XMLSERVICE
RPG is usually considered server side of XMLSERVICE, a called RPG PGM or SRVPGM (web service), but RPG is well versed in DB2, therefore can also be used as RPG client to XMLSERVICE. In fact, client RPG DB2 connection to XMLSERVICE will likely be fastest and easiest choice, especially for your remote IBM i systems (WRKRDBDIRE).

The RPG client examples will demonstrate RPG CGI using XMLSERVICE via Apache configuration, but the techniques also work as batch or green screen application, after using XMLSERVICE for a while, you may realize just how little code you have to write to do a great deal of work.

The simple example is of course a bit contrived, simply extracting strings between [@<data>output</data>@] returned XMLSERVICE output, but serves to demonstrate XMLSERVICE call using [@Exec Sql call XMLSERVICE/iPLUG4K(:myIPC,:myCtl,:myXmlIn,:myXmlOut);@].

'''What is happening?'''

The flow of ZZRPGSQL.PGM is similar to HTML/XML, except we are using the XMLSERVICE provided stored procedure interface to call XMLSERVICE.
* We point our browser to [@http://lp0364d:10022/cgi-bin/zzrpgsql.pgm@], which is RPG CGI program ZZRPGSQL.PGM. 
* ZZRPGSQL.PGM uses XMLSERVICE DB2 interface [@Exec Sql call XMLSERVICE/iPLUG4K(:myIPC,:myCtl,:myXmlIn,:myXmlOut);@], passing XML input request myXmlIn to XMLSERVICE. 
* XMLSERVICE.PGM parses XML input and dynamically loads/activates/calls target ZZCALL.PGM with included parameters [@<parm>...</parm>@].
* ZZCALL.PGM runs using normal in/out parameters (memory)
* XMLSERVICE.PGM parses in/out parameters from ZZCALL.PGM into output XML document
* ZZRPGSQL.PGM myXmlOut variable contains XML output document
* ZZRPGSQL.PGM parses myXmlOut into a HTML table output (writeIFS)
* browser sees the HTML table of ZZCALL data 

!!! RPG client XMLSERVICE (*SRVPGM)
RPG program ZZVRYSQL.PGM demonstrates client use of XMLSERVICE calling a *SRVPGM (ZZSRV.ZZVARY). As you read source code for ZZVRYSQL.PGM, you will see it is nearly identical to previous example ZZRPGSQL.PGM.

@]
XMLSERVICE called ZZSRV.ZZARRY SRVPGM demonstrates advance functions problematic for PCML based web services.
* difficult -- parameter [@10A varying@] - PCML requires multiple XML definitions for length, data
* impossible -- return [@20A varying@] - PCML has no ability to return complex data (only single integer)
