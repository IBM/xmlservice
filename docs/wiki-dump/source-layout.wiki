!!! XMLSERVICE hooks plugconf(n)
XMLSERVICE allows for you to customize a few key security and output decisions in the RPG modules plugconf(n) or provide your own plugconf(x) version. Today there are three versions of plugconf(n) that are used to compile XMLSERVICE (and other programs):
* plugconf1 - XMLSERVICE library for testing
* plugconf2 - ZENDSVR library update Zend production product
* plugconf3 - XMLSERVICE library for YiPs demo site

'''XMLSERVICE hooks APIs plugconf_h'''

The hooks are ONLY available with XMLSERVICE version 1.5.5+.

Each of the plugconf(n) modules must implement the following interfaces prototyped by plugconf_h ... failure to implement these APIs will result in compile failure.

There are key hooks in plugrun / xmlcgi that allow your to decline service after you snoop the input XML. Likewise, there are key hooks that allow you to manipulate the XML output returned to the clients if you wish to "customize" XML (cool), however it should be noted that if you change the output XML you may break other clients (like Zend PHP wrapper).

Probably the best way to understand these is to simply look into plugconf3 used on the YiPs site at this time (but i will get round to full explanation).

!!! Running with *NONE from XMLCGI
XMLSERVICE via XMLCGI may be too powerful using only HTML/XML with no user/password (*NONE), so it is turned OFF by default always. However, if your machine is behind a firewall and you trust your team you can enable *NONE ... 
# change plugconf1 or plugconf2 or plugconf3 or make your own plugconf
# D PLUGNONEOK      S              1N   inz(*ON)
# recompile and your machine will be wide open ...

Note: The other setting PLUGDEMOOK is not used is future consideration for demos not from XMLCGI.

* plugconf1 and plugconf2 disables *NONE for security default (crtxml, crtxml2)

!!! XMLSERVICE XMLCGI (RPG CGI)
A sample XMLCGI interface was included to allow REST calls to XMLSERVICE. This was very handy to check out XML to/from XMLSERVICE before ever committing pen to paper on an actual script like PHP. It also seems to very handy fro one off HTML/XML applications that can reside on your laptop (or other device) and use the built in browser to run IBM i. 


''BIG DESIGN HINT:''

Although common practice in IBM i circles, I choose not to use Basic Authentication and/or "switch profile" in RPG CGI programs on the web (httpd.conf ServerId). I much prefer to leave all Apache/CGI related jobs as neutral "low authority" like QTMHHTTP (IBM i) or NOBODY (Linux) for clearly understood security. Also, I prefer keeping any security "switch profile" activity in the database connection (DB2) for portability of design and multiple client support (1-tier/2-tier). An example of this "database security" style of CGI is Apache module XMLCGI included in XMLSERVICE download (main page). XMLCGI implements all "security" preferences and "switch profile" using the DB2 CLI interface in RPG. 

Briefly, reasons i like keep the "profile security" in the database ...
* portable design idea in tradition of millions of PHP/MySql web sites (idea of profile is in database)
* easy switch/sharing between 1-tier and 2-tier applications across common database design (DB2)
* no "protocol" invention required because most languages support database (including PHP, Java, RPG, Cobol, etc.)
* supporting/sharing applications a wide range of device clients such as PDAs, laptops, servers is much easier as most can handle REST and/or DB2 communications (whatever language is available)

''Do it yourself RPG:''

* ''If you are a do it yourself RPG programmer, you may want to download and study XMLCGI RPG source file included as this would allow you to write any RPG front-end (just steal the DB2 CLI stuff in XMLCGI if you want a server with profiles).''
** RPG program XMLCGI is a traditional "Apache/Unix" style CGI server (ala PHP/MySql), therefore you do not need "switch profile" in the XMLCGI job. All/any "switch profile" is occurring at the DB2 database layer via DB2 CLI server mode not the Apache level (without using profiles in httpd.conf)
** WARNING: Unless https, XMLCGI sends unencrypted password around web and/or leaves them in files (unless using *NONE), which is a bad idea of course, but this is a demonstration module for testing (without PHP, etc.), you as the RPG programmer are intended to customize to your production world (Open Source RPG code). 

'''Warning XMLCGI - prior 1.6.8'''

%green%redistribution xmlcgi binary has been fixed 1.6.8%%

prior 1.6.8 - For this feature to work between releases you have to download source and compile XMLSERVICE XMLCGI matching correct IBM i release V5R4, V6R1, etc., (see installation instructions from main page). BTW -- This means XMLCGI version shipped by Zend created on V5R4 will not work on V6+.

!!! XMLSERVICE XMLMAIN (unused)
Also included, is a simple RPG program XMLMAIN that calls client interface XMLSERVICE in processes inside or outside web context, has not been extensively tested (very little in fact), but should be general idea for a IBM i RPG centric interface (if such a thing is even relevant these Internet days).
** If you wish to build a traditional web IBM i "switch profile" CGI web service (httpd.conf ServerId), you would need to combine parts of XMLMAIN (direct call XMLSERVICE) and XMLCGI (excluding DB2 CLI).
